# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN
- Designed and implemented a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The model was trained with data augmentation techniques and Batch Normalization to improve accuracy and stability.
  
- It achieved strong performance with 93.77% training accuracy, 92.86% validation accuracy, and 95.83% test accuracy. Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report confirmed the modelâ€™s effectiveness and reliability in identifying pneumonia cases.
